## Core Models

### User
**Business Purpose**: Central user authentication and authorization model using Devise. Manages user profiles, roles, permissions, and relationships with organizations. Users can belong to groups, upload documents, create baskets, and participate in validation workflows. Supports multi-level roles (user, manager, admin, super_admin) with a flexible permission system.

**Key Features & Traps**:
- Uses both role-based (enum) and permission-based (JSON column) authorization
- `uploaded_by_id` foreign key links to documents (not standard `user_id`)
- Permissions can be stored as Array or Hash in JSON column - code handles both formats
- Has specific ImmoPromo module integration methods (`accessible_projects`, `can_manage_project?`)
- `has_permission?` checks both direct permissions and group permissions

**Questions/Evolution**:
- Why mix role-based and permission-based auth? Consider unified approach
- Permission storage format inconsistency (Array vs Hash) should be normalized
- Consider extracting ImmoPromo-specific methods to a concern
- Add caching for permission checks to improve performance

**Useful Patterns**:
- `add_permission!` and `remove_permission` methods for permission management
- Flexible permission checking through groups and direct assignment
- `display_name` fallback pattern (full_name || email)

### Organization
**Business Purpose**: Multi-tenant root entity that owns spaces, users, user groups, and metadata templates. Organizations provide data isolation and serve as the top-level container for all resources. Each organization has a unique slug for URL-friendly identification.

**Key Features & Traps**:
- Auto-generates slug from name if not provided
- Has direct association with `immo_promo_projects` (engine-specific)
- All dependent resources cascade delete
- No validation on settings or other business rules

**Questions/Evolution**:
- Add organization-level settings (storage quotas, feature flags)
- Consider soft-delete instead of cascade delete
- Add billing/subscription management
- Implement organization-level audit trail

**Useful Patterns**:
- Slug generation pattern for URL-friendly identifiers
- Clean cascade deletion setup

### Document ‚ö†Ô∏è MOD√àLE CRITIQUE - 580+ lignes
**Business Purpose**: Core document management model with versioning, processing pipeline, validation workflow, and AI capabilities. Supports file uploads, metadata, tagging, sharing, locking, and state management through AASM. Documents can be organized in spaces/folders and linked to other entities via polymorphic associations.

**Key Features & Traps**:
- Uses PaperTrail for versioning with custom DocumentVersion class (inherits from PaperTrail::Version)
- Complex state machine with 6 states (draft, published, locked, archived, marked_for_deletion, deleted)
- Two separate enum systems: `processing_status` and `virus_scan_status`
- Polymorphic `documentable` association for linking to any model
- AI processing happens asynchronously after base processing completes
- Supports both direct authorization and space-level permissions
- Version tracking includes file metadata, comments, and creator information
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ATTENTION**: `lock!` method override PaperTrail - voir warning au d√©marrage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PI√àGE**: `editable_by?` d√©pend de `locked_by_user?` ET `writable_by?`

**Questions/Evolution**:
- ‚ùó URGENT: D√©composer en concerns (Document::Lockable, Document::AIProcessable, etc.)
- State machine has many states - could be simplified
- Processing pipeline could use ActiveJob workflows
- Large model (580+ lines) - needs decomposition

**Useful Patterns**:
- Comprehensive processing status tracking
- Flexible metadata system (both structured and unstructured)
- Good separation of sync/async processing
- Well-designed permission checking with multiple levels

### Space

- Consider space templates for standard structures
- Add space-level metadata capabilities
- Implement archival instead of deletion

**Useful Patterns**:
- Clean use of Authorizable concern
- Scoped uniqueness validation pattern

### Folder
**Business Purpose**: Hierarchical organization structure within spaces using the Treeable concern. Folders can contain documents and have their own metadata. Supports nested folder structures with path tracking.

**Key Features & Traps**:
